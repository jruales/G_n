\section{Introduction}

Heegaard Floer homology is an invariant of 3-manifolds introduced by Ozsv\'{a}th and Szab\'{o} \cite{OzsvathSzabo}. In its simplest form, it associates to a closed 3-manifold $Y$ a graded $\mathbb{F}_2$ vector space, denoted $\widehat{HF}(Y)$. It was shown by Ozsv\'{a}th and Szab\'{o} \cite[Proposition 5.1]{OS2} that if $Y$ is a rational homology 3-sphere then
\begin{align*}
\textup{rk }\widehat{HF}(Y)\geq{}|H_1(Y ; \mathbb{Z})|.
\end{align*}

\begin{definition}An \emph{L-space} is a rational homology sphere $Y$ with simplest possible Heegaard Floer homology, that is, with
\begin{align*}
\textup{rk } \widehat{HF}(Y) = |H_1(Y ; \mathbb{Z})|.
\end{align*}
\end{definition}

Lens spaces are L-spaces, motivating the name. It is interesting to ask whether there exist alternative characterizations of L-spaces that do not depend on Heegaard Floer homology \cite[Question 11]{OS4}. We know that if $Y$ is an L-space then $Y$ does not admit a $C^{2}$ co-orientable, taut foliation \cite{OS3}. The non-existence of a co-orientable, taut foliation has been proposed by Ozsv\'{a}th and Szab\'{o} as a possible characterization of L-spaces. Along similar lines, a conjecture has been proposed \cite{BoyerGordonWatson} that attempts to characterize L-spaces through a property of their fundamental group.

\begin{conjecture_main}
An irreducible rational homology 3-sphere is an L-space if and only if its fundamental group is not left-orderable.
\end{conjecture_main}

Recall that a left-orderable group is a group which admits a left-invariant total order.

The conjectured relationship between L-spaces and left-orderability is already known for 3-manifolds that are double branched covers of non-split alternating links. It has been shown that for a non-split alternating link $K\subset S^3$, the fundamental group of $\Sigma{}(K)$ is not left-orderable \cite{BoyerGordonWatson} (cf. \cite{GreeneJE}, \cite{Ito}), where $\Sigma{}(K)$ denotes the double branched cover of $K\subset{}S^3$. Furthermore, Manolescu and Ozsv\'{a}th \cite{ManolescuOzsvath} showed that alternating links, and more generally, quasi-alternating knots, are homologically thin. In turn, Ozsv\'{a}th and Szab\'{o} showed in \cite{OzsvathandSzabo} that for a homologically thin link $K$, its double branched cover is an L-space. Therefore, if a 3-manifold $M$ is the double branched cover of some non-split alternating link, then $M$ is an L-space and $\pi_1(M)$ is not left-orderable.

We will verify that a specific class of L-spaces arising from the double branched covers of Kanenobu's knot (see Figure~\ref{figure:kanenobu}) have fundamental groups which are not left-orderable. We will consider the knots $K_n$ for $n\geq{}0$, defined as
\begin{align*}
K_n=K_{-10n,10n+3}.
\end{align*}
\noindent{}It was shown by Greene and Watson that $K_n$ is homologically thin (but not quasi-alternating), and so $\Sigma{}(K_n)$ is an L-space for $n\geq{}0$ \cite[Proposition 11]{GreeneWatson}. Generically, $K_n$ is non-alternating and $\Sigma{}(K_n)$ is hyperbolic and can not be obtained by surgery on a knot in $S^{3}$ \cite{HoffmanWalsh}, so these manifolds fall outside of the classes considered in \cite{BoyerGordonWatson}. The fundamental group, $G_n$, of the double branched cover of $K_n$ was computed by Greene and Watson \cite{GreeneWatson}, and has the following presentation:


\begin{align*}
G_n=\pi{}_1(\Sigma{}(K_n))=\langle a,\; b,\; c,\; d \mid{} &(a^{-1}b)^{10n}d^{-1}a^{2},\; b^{-2}c(b^{-1}a)^{10n},\\
&(d^{-1}c)^{10n+3}c^{-1}bc^{-2},\; d^{2}a^{-1}d(c^{-1}d)^{10n+3} \rangle
\end{align*}
where we have renamed the four generators $v_1$, $v_2$, $v_3$, and $v_4$ from the original paper as $a$, $b$, $c$, and $d$, respectively.

\begin{theorem*} The fundamental group $G_n$ of the double branched cover of $K_n$ is not left-orderable.
\label{MAINTHEOREM}
\end{theorem*}

\noindent{} Next, we introduce various definitions and give background on left-orderability.

\subsection{Left-orderability}

%\begin{definition}

%A {\it total order} on a set $X$ is a binary relation $\leq$ satisfying the following for all $x, y, z \in{} X$:
%\begin{enumerate}
%\item $x\leq{}x$ (reflexivity)
%\item $x\leq{}y$ and $y\leq{}x$ implies $x=y$ (anti-symmetry)
%\item $x\leq{}y$ and $y\leq{}z$ implies $x\leq{}z$ (transitivity)
%\item $x\leq{}y$ or $y\leq{}x$ (totality)
%\end{enumerate}
%\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
A group $G$ is {\it left-orderable} if its elements can be given a left-invariant total order. That is, a total order $<$ such that $g<h$ implies $fg<fh$ for all $f, g, h\in{}G$.
\end{definition}

\begin{remark} By convention the trivial group is not left-orderable.
\end{remark}

%\begin{definition} Given a left-orderable group $(G,<)$ we can define a %binary relation $<$ on $G$ in the following way:
%\begin{align*}
%x<y\Leftrightarrow{}x\leq{}y\; \textrm{and} \; x\neq{}y.
%\end{align*}
%\end{definition}
We recall some facts on left-orderable groups from \cite{ClayRolfsen}.

\begin{fact} For some left-orderable group $(G, <)$ we can define {\it a} corresponding relation $>$ in the following way: for $g,h\in{}G$, $g>h$ if and only if $h<g$. This notational convenience will be used frequently.
\end{fact}

\begin{fact} In a left-orderable group G, $1<g$ (``$g$ is positive") if and only if $g^{-1}<1$ (``$g^{-1}$ is negative").
\label{fact:inverses}
\end{fact}
%\begin{proof}
%\begin{align*}
%1<g\Leftrightarrow{}(g^{-1})1<(g^{-1})g\Leftrightarrow{}g^{-1}<1.
%\end{align*}
%\end{proof}

\begin{fact} Transitivity implies that in a left-orderable group products of positive elements are positive and products of negative elements are negative.
\label{1.3LO}
\end{fact}

%\noindent{}We now prove a few useful properties of left-orderable groups.
\begin{proposition} In a left-orderable group $G$, $g\in{}G$ has the same sign as $g^{n}$ for any $n>1$.
\label{proposition:pospowers}
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof} Consequence of Fact \ref{1.3LO}.
%The claim is clear if $g=1$, so we can assume $g<1$. Note that if $g>1$, then we can multiply both sides on the left by $g$ to obtain $g^2>g>1$ and once more to obtain $g^3>g^2>g>1$. Continuing this process shows that $g^n>1$ for any $n>1$ if $g>1$. Similarly, $xg^n<1$ for any $n>1$ if $g<1$. Suppose now that $g>1$ and suppose (for contradiction) that $g^{n}<1$ for some $n>1$. By Proposition~\ref{proposition:inverses}, $g^{-1}<1$ and as noted above, this shows that $g^{n-1}<1$ for any $n>1$. Therefore, $g=(g^{n-1})(g^n)<g^{n-1}<1$, contradicting the fact that $g>1$. A similar proof works when $g<1$.
\end{proof}

\begin{fact} A left-orderable group has no torsion.
\label{fact:torsion}
\end{fact}
%\begin{proof} Suppose G is a left-orderable group, and suppose (for contradiction) that there exists some non-trivial $g\in{}G$ such that $g^{n}=1$ for some $n>1$. We know that either $g>1$ or $g<1$. If $g>1$ then $g^{2}>g>1$ and $g^{3}>g^{2}>g>1$. We can continue this process until we reach $g^{n}$:
%\begin{align*}
%1=g^{n}>g^{n-1}>\cdots{}>g^{2}>g>1.
%\end{align*}
%This is a contradiction. The case when $g<1$ is similar.
%\end{proof}

%\begin{corollary} Every finite group is not left-orderable.
%\end{corollary}
%\begin{proof} Suppose $G$ is a group of finite order. Note: by convention, the trivial group is not left-orderable. We will assume $G$ is non-trivial. Choose $g\in{}G$ such that $g\neq{}1$. The cyclic subgroup $\langle{}g\rangle{}\subset{}G$ is necessarily finite since it is a subgroup of the finite group $G$. This means that $g^{n}=1$ for some $n>1$, and thus $G$ is not left-orderable by Fact~\ref{fact:torsion}.
%\end{proof}

\begin{fact} Let $G$ be a non-trivial group and let $g\in{}G$. There exists a left-ordering $<$ on $G$ such that $g<1$ if and only if there exists a left-ordering $<^\prime$ on $G$ such that $1<^\prime g$.
\label{fact:WLOG}
\end{fact}
%\begin{proof} Suppose there exists a left-ordering $<$ on $G$ such that $g<1$. For $x,y\in{}G$, define $<'$ by:
%\begin{align*}
%x<'y\Leftrightarrow{}y<x.
%\end{align*}
%Because of the properties of $<$, $<'$ is clearly a left-invariant total ordering on $G$. With this definition of $<'$, it is clear that $1<'g$. A similar proof is clear for the converse direction.
%\end{proof}

\noindent{}We can also define left-orderability in a different way:

\begin{proposition} A group $G$ is left-orderable if and only if there exists a subset $P\subset{}G$ such that:
\begin{enumerate}
\item $P\cdot{}P\subset{}P$
\item $P\cap{}P^{-1}=\emptyset{}$
\item $G=P\cup{}P^{-1}\cup{}\{ 1 \}$
\end{enumerate}
\label{proposition:poscone}
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof} Suppose $G$ is left-orderable. Define
\begin{align*}
P=\Set*{g\in{}G}{1<g}.
\end{align*}
Then $P\cdot{}P\subset{}P$ since if $g>1$ and $h>1$ then $gh>g>1$. Therefore, $P$ satisfies the first condition. If $g>1$ then $g^{-1}<1$ and so $P\cap{}P^{-1}=\emptyset{}$. Therefore, $P$ satisfies the second condition. Finally, by the totality of a total ordering, all non-trivial elements in $G$ must be either positive or negative, thus $P\cup{}P^{-1}\cup{}\{ 1 \}$. Therefore, $P$ satisfies the third condition, completing one direction of the proof.\\
\\
Conversely, suppose there exists a subset $P\subset{}G$ satisfying the three conditions of the proposition. Define a left ordering in the following way:
\begin{align*}
g<h\Leftrightarrow{}g^{-1}h\in{}P.
\end{align*}
It is easy to check this defines a left-ordering.
%We will now verify that this is a left-invariant total order. Reflexivity is clear. Anti-symmetry follows from the second condition on $P$, namely  $P\cap{}P^{-1}=\emptyset{}$. This means that it is not possible for both an element and its inverse to be in $P$, and thus for $x,y\in{}G$, $x<y$ and $y<x$ is impossible, so $x\leq{}y$ and $y\leq{}x$ implies $x=y$. Totality is clear from the fact that $G=P\cup{}P^{-1}\cup{}\{ 1 \}$. To prove transitivity, suppose $x,y,z\in{}G$ and $x<y$ and $y<z$. Then $x^{-1}y\in{}P$ and $y^{-1}z\in{}P$. Since $P\cdot{}P\subset{}P$, $(x^{-1}y)(y^{-1}z)=x^{-1}z\in{}P$, and thus $x<z$. Therefore, $<$ is a total order on $G$. Now for $g,h,x\in{}G$, suppose $g<h$. Then:
%\begin{align*}
%g^{-1}h\in{}P\\
%\Rightarrow{}g^{-1}(x^{-1}x)h\in{}P\\
%\Rightarrow{}(g^{-1}x^{-1})(xh)\in{}P\\
%\Rightarrow{}xg<xh.
%\end{align*}
%This shows that $<$ is a left invariant total order, completing the proof.
\end{proof}

\begin{definition} For a group $G$, a subset $P\subset{}G$ satisfying the three conditions of Proposition~\ref{proposition:poscone} is called a {\it positive cone}.
\end{definition}

%The checkerboard coloring of $K_n$ is shown in Figure~\ref{figure:kanenobuCheckboard}. Using this, and Following the procedures outlined in Definition~\ref{DefBWD}, we have Figure \ref{figure:kanenobuWG}, and by Greene's Theorem, we have that for all $n\geq{}0$ from

\subsection{Automated Proofs}
Several of the proofs for lemmas and propositions in this paper were generated by a computer program we created for the task. We will now briefly describe the algorithm our program employs, as it could be useful for future work in disproving the left-orderability of certain groups. Our program is similar to the program described in \cite[Section 8]{CalegariDunfield}.

For the proof that $G_n$ is not left-orderable, we argue by contradiction. That is, we assume that $G_n$ is left-orderable, thus for any left-ordering on $G_n$, there must exist a positive cone $P\subset{}G_n$. Based on Fact~\ref{fact:WLOG}, we can proceed under the assumption that $b^{-1}a\in{}P$, and then find additional elements of $G_n$ that must be contained in such a positive cone. With the addition of enough elements, we can in many cases reach a contradiction.

In order to accomplish this, the program takes two inputs:
\begin{enumerate}
\item A set $Q\subset{}P$ of elements that have been proven (either in previous iterations of the program, or by hand) to be contained in $P$, including $b^{-1}a$. This set will grow during the execution of the program, but we will ensure that it always is a subset of $P$, so $Q$ has the property inherited from $P$ that $1\not\in Q^{*}$, where $Q^*$ is the semigroup generated by $Q$. 
\item A subset $I$ of all words that we know are equal to the identity based on the group relations of $G_n$, closed under inversion and cyclic permutation. See (\ref{intro:cyclic}) for an example of what is meant by cyclic permutation.
\end{enumerate}
\begin{remark}
Words that are equal to the identity are henceforth referred to as identities.
\end{remark}
The four group relations of $G_n$ are obvious examples of identities. To give another example, Lemma~\ref{lemma:eq5} shows that $d^{-1}a^{2}b^{-2}c$ is also an identity. The cyclic permutations of this identity would be:
\begin{align}
\{d^{-1}a^{2}b^{-2}c,\; cd^{-1}a^{2}b^{-2},\; b^{-1}cd^{-1}a^{2}b^{-1},\nonumber{}\\
b^{-2}cd^{-1}a^{2},\; ab^{-2}cd^{-1}a,\; a^{2}b^{-2}cd^{-1}\}. \label{intro:cyclic}
\end{align}

% For any such left-ordering, we consider the set $A=\{P\subset{}G_n\mid{}P \textrm{ is a positive cone and } b^{-1}a\in{}P\}$. We then show that $A$ is empty by reaching contradictions for all such $P$.


%$P=\{x\in G_n|1<x\}$, which satisfies the previously described properties of a positive cone. Thus, proving that such a $P$ doesn't satisfy the properties of a positive cone is equivalent to showing $G_n$ is not left-orderable.

%The program then performs two sorts of checks:

%Maybe we should skip these next two paragraphs entirely? These talk about checking for internal consistancy of the positive cone and list of identities, but the way I worded the above makes it seem (as I think it should) that the elements of the positive cone are known absolutely to be positive and that identities are also "infalible". It makes more sense, I think, to just talk about how the program addresses elements of unknown sign.

%First, since we know that $P$ is closed under the group operation and that $P\cap P^{-1}=\emptyset$, the program checks if the inverse of any element in $P$ is also in $P$, that is, that it can be expressed as a product of elements in $P$. If it can, then this element is contained in both $P$ and $P^{-1}$, a contradiction.

%Second, the program checks if any of the identities (including their inverses and conjugates, which are also identities) can be expressed as a combination of elements in the positive cone. If any of them can, then we reach the conclusion that the identity is positive, again a contradiction.

%If neither the unknown sign element nor its inverse causes a contradiction,

Pseudocode for a simplified version of the program follows, where $A^*$ denotes the semigroup generated by the elements of $A$.\\

\begin{algorithmic}
\LOOP
\STATE $x\gets$ next nontrivial element of unknown sign
  \IF {$I\cap{}(Q\cup{}\{x\})^*=\emptyset{}$ \AND $I\cap{}(Q\cup{}\{x^{-1}\})^*\neq{\emptyset{}}$}
    \STATE {\textbf{add} $x$ \textbf{to} $Q$}
    \PRINT {$x$ added to positive list}
  \ELSIF {$I\cap{}(Q\cup{}\{x\})^*\neq{}\emptyset{}$ \AND $I\cap{}(Q\cup{}\{x^{-1}\})^*={\emptyset{}}$}
    \STATE {\textbf{add} $x^{-1}$ \textbf{to} $Q$}
    \PRINT {$x^{-1}$ added to positive list}
  \ELSIF {$I\cap{}(Q\cup{}\{x\})^*\neq{}\emptyset{}$ \AND $I\cap{}(Q\cup{}\{x^{-1}\})^*\neq{}{\emptyset{}}$}
    \PRINT {$x$ causes a contradiction}
    \STATE {\textbf{program halts}}
  \ENDIF
\ENDLOOP
\end{algorithmic}
$\;$\\
The ``next nontrivial element of unknown sign" from line 2 can either be user-input or computer-generated. Since there are infinite elements of unknown sign, we (or the computer) give preference to those elements with lowest word length, e.g. $c^{-1}d$ before $c^{-1}d^2$.

Within the program's \textbf{if} statements, we compute the intersection between the finite set $I$ and infinite semigroups generated by $Q\cup{}\{x\}$ or $Q\cup{}\{x^{-1}\}$. This is possible in finitely many operations because $I$ is finite and the semigroup is finitely generated. We use a method similar to using a deterministic finite automaton with the finitely generated semigroup as a language to check elements in $I$.

%The version of the algorithm that we employed keeps track of the reasoning behind the addition of an element to the positive list, which we then use in our proofs.



%begin{algorithmic}
%while true
%  $x\gets$ next element of unknown sign
%  if $I\cap{}(Q\cup{}x)^*=\emptyset{}$ \AND $I\cap{}(Q\cup{}x^{-1})^*\neq{\emptyset{}}$
%    \PRINT $I\cap{}(Q\cup{}q^{-1})^*$
%    add $x$ to $Q$
%  else if $I\cap{}(Q\cup{}x)^*\neq{}\emptyset{}$ \AND $I\cap{}(Q\cup{}x^{-1})^*={\emptyse%t{}}$
%    \PRINT $I\cap{}(Q\cup{}x)^*$
%    add $x^{-1}$ to $Q$
%  else if $I\cap{}(Q\cup{}x)^*=\emptyset{}$ \AND $I\cap{}(Q\cup{}x^{-1})^*=\emptyset{}$
%    \PRINT $I\cap{}(Q\cup{}q^{-1})^*$
%    \PRINT $I\cap{}(Q\cup{}q^{-1})^*$
%    STOP
%\end{algorithmic}

%For the elements whose sign we do not know (in ascending order by word length after accounting for cancellations), the program gets the first of these elements, call it $q$, and tries two cases\textemdash{}Case 1: $q$ is positive, Case 2: $q^{-1}$ is positive

%checks for any of the [[[[two mentioned contradictions]]]]. It then replaces this recently-added element in the positive cone list with the inverse of the same element and again checks for contradictions.

%If none of these two elements (neither the unknown-sign element nor its inverse) causes a contradiction when assumed to be positive, the program gains no information, so it tries the next item of unknown sign.

%If one of the two causes a contradiction, the program adds the inverse permanently to the positive cone and continues with another element we do not know the sign of.

%Finally, if both the element and its inverse cause a contradiction, the program reaches a general contradiction, and it halts.

\subsection{Outline}
The paper is organized as follows. In Section~\ref{section:G_0}, we provide a proof that $G_0$ is not left-orderable. The case when $n=0$ is addressed separately because the proof for $n>0$ does not hold when $n=0$. The remainder of the paper is then devoted to a proof for the cases $n>0$. To facilitate the proof, we consider sixteen cases (see Table~\ref{table:casesAll}) based on the signs of the four generators of $G_n$ and disprove left-orderability in each. In Section~\ref{section:identityProofs} we show that the four generators of $G_n$ are non-trivial, justifying the totality of the sixteen cases we will address. In Section~\ref{section:generalLemmas} we prove lemmas that hold in all cases and that will be useful for later proofs. With these tools, left-orderability is straightforward to disprove in eleven of the sixteen cases, and we address these in Section~\ref{section:manyCases}. We disprove left-orderability in Cases 3, 4, 8, 1, and 16  in Sections~\ref{section:case3},~\ref{section:case4},~\ref{section:case8},~\ref{section:case1}, and~\ref{section:case16} respectively.
