We show that the fundamental group of the double branched cover of an infinite family of homologically thin, non-quasi-alternating knots is not left-orderable, giving further support for a conjecture of Boyer, Gordon, and Watson that an irreducible rational homology 3-sphere is an L-space if and only if its fundamental group is not left-orderable.
